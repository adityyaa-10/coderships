        In today&apos;s competitive tech landscape, it&apos;s not enough to
        simply list your skills or mention some capstone projects on a resume.
        Traditional resumes often fail to adequately convey your coding
        abilities. Many students struggle to gain practical experience in the
        tech industry, making it difficult to stand out to potential employers.
