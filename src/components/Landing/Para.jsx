                In today&apos;s competitive tech landscape, it&apos;s not enough to simply list
                your skills or mention some capstone projects on a resume.
                Traditional resumes often fail to adequately convey your coding
                abilities. Many students struggle to gain practical experience in the
                tech industry, making it difficult to stand out to potential employers.
