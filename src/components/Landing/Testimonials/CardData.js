They push you to develop skills that you just can't get from building some capstone projects. If you're able to successfully complete these projects, you'll end up with a portfolio of truly unique, outstanding work that will help you shine when applying for internships. ",

Coderships provided me with the perfect opportunity to dive into real-world scenarios and build features/frontend components inspired from real-time websites from scratch.

The challenges forced me to learn new things I haven't done before, like installing custom fonts in frontend, implementing font preloading, next.js progress bar etc. It was challenging at times, but I'm so glad I stuck with it because now I feel way more prepared for a real internship. The feedback from the developers working at companies who reviewed my projects was super helpful in showing me where I needed to improve.",
